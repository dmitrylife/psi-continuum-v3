This repository provides a minimal standalone script used to generate
the illustrative ΔΨ response plot shown in Psi–Continuum Cosmology v3.

The script is not used for parameter estimation or data fitting and
serves purely as a conceptual visualization accompanying the paper.

This repository includes the preprint PDF of Psi–Continuum Cosmology v3
for reference only. The code in this repository is limited to figure
generation.
